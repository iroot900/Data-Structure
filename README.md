# Data-Structure (C++)
This repository include my implementation of many widely used non-trivial data structures. Templates are used to make them more generic and ready to use for project.

>HashTable with Chaining

>HashTable with Open addressing (Linear probe)

For my test case, when HashTables have same number of buckets, chaining is about 2 times as faster as open addressing. But chaining takes more memory since all nodes contain a pointer to next node. That being said, if using same memory, open addresing could have twice as much buckets, and in this case, difference is very small.
